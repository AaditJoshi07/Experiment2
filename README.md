**Aim:-**

To study and implement basic operations on Python data structures—specifically lists—such as creation, indexing, updating, appending, inserting, removing, extending, slicing, and sorting, along with practical applications like managing student names and marks.

**THEORY:-**

* Lists in Python are ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of any data type.

* Duplicates are allowed in lists, making them flexible for real-world data like names or marks.

* Indexing lets you access elements using positive or negative positions (e.g., list[0], list[-1]).

* Appending adds an element to the end of the list using append().

* Inserting places an element at a specific index using insert(index, value).

* Replacing updates an existing element by assigning a new value to a specific index.

* Extending combines two lists using either + or extend() method.

* Slicing retrieves a subset of elements using range-based indexing like list[2:5].

* Removing deletes a specific element using remove(value).

* Sorting arranges elements in ascending order using sort().

* Length of a list is found using len(), useful for counting elements.

* Mathematical operations like max(), min(), sum() help analyze numerical lists.

* Average calculation is done by dividing sum(list) by len(list).

**ALGORITHM:-**

1. <ins>Student Name List Operations:-</ins>

-->Create a list of 5 student names.

-->Display the first and last student using indexing.

-->Add a new student using append().

-->Remove one student using remove().

-->Sort the list alphabetically using sort().

2. <ins>Student Marks List Operations:-</ins>

-->Create a list of student marks.

-->Display the highest mark using max() and the lowest using min().

-->Calculate the total using sum() and count using len().

-->Compute the average by dividing total by count.

-->Sort the marks in ascending order using sort().
